This is a collection of tools to extract data from the Indianapolis Landlord Registry, 
which is administered by the Department of Code Enforcement. The data is hosted in
Accella (http://permitsandcases.indy.gov), a rather hostile system. The process to
find the contact information for a landlord or property manager for a specific property
is difficult for regular citizens and resists systemic analysis of registration data. 

This toolset aims to remedy that situation, first by extracting data from the registry
and eventually by presenting it in an easy to user public facing database with a map.
